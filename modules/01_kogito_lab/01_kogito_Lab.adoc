.Sample output
----
The server is using a certificate that does not match its hostname: x509: certificate is valid for kubernetes, kubernetes.default, kubernetes.default.sv
c, kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local, master00.example.com, openshift, openshift.default, openshift.default.svc, openshift.default.svc.cluster.local,
 172.30.0.1, 192.168.0.10, not master00-b8ad.generic.opentlc.com
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.

* When prompted, enter the pasword provided by the instructor.
. To access the OpenShift cluster console from your laptop, open a browser window and navigate to the url https://master00-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com - replace <GUID> with the lab GUID from the GuidGrabber tool.
