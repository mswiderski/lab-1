= RHTE 2019: Cloud-Native and Serverless Processes and Decisions with jBPM, Drools and Quarkus

:numbered:

== Lab environment and setup

.Prerequisites
.. The `ssh` utility installed on your laptop.
.. Web browser installed on your laptop.
.. Broadband internet connectivity.

A lab environment is provided to you. The environment consists of:

* An Openshift cluster.
* A virtual machine with developer tools (git, JDK, Maven, GraalVM) installed.

To obtain access to your lab environment:

. In a browser window, navigate to the RHTE _GuidGrabber_ at https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=???
+
image::images/guid_grabber_1.png[]
. Select the *Lab Code* : `S003 - Cloud-Native and Serverless Processes and Decisions with jBPM, Drools and Quarkus`
. Enter the *Activation Key* provided by your instructor.
. Enter your *E-Mail Address*.
. Click *Submit*
. The resulting page will display your lab's _GUID_ and other useful information about your lab environment.
+
image::images/guid_grabber_2.png[]
. Open a terminal window and log into the lab virtual machine:
+
----
$ export GUID=<your GUID obtained from the GuidGrabber>
$ ssh lab-user@workstation-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----
* When prompted, enter the password provided by the instructor.
. From the workstation, you can log into the OpenShift cluster using the `oc` utility:
+
----
$ oc login -u user1 https://master00.example.com -u user1
----
+
.Sample output
----
The server is using a certificate that does not match its hostname: x509: certificate is valid for kubernetes, kubernetes.default, kubernetes.default.sv
c, kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local, master00.example.com, openshift, openshift.default, openshift.default.svc, openshift.default.svc.cluster.local,
 172.30.0.1, 192.168.0.10, not master00-b8ad.generic.opentlc.com
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

Username: user1
Password:
Login successful.
----
* Accept to use insecure connections.
* When prompted, enter the pasword provided by the instructor.
. To access the OpenShift cluster console from your laptop, open a browser window and navigate to the url https://master00-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com - replace <GUID> with the lab GUID from the GuidGrabber tool.
* Your OpenShift cluster uses self-signed certificates, so expect a security warning in the browser. Create a security exception and proceed.
* Login with user `user1` and the password provided by the lab instructor.


== Use Case

During this workshop we will create and deploy a software system for a startup travel agency called Kogito Travel Agency.
The system will consist of a Kogito _Booking System Service_ implemented with a BPMN2 process definition and rules.

The _Hotel Booking_ and _Flight Booking_ functionalities are implemented as _private_ subprocesses

image:images/book-hotel-process.png[]

image:images/book-flight-process.png[]

These processes call _Hotel Booking Service_ and _Flight Booking Service_, which are both implemented as CDI beans that have hard coded logic to return a booked flight or hotel.

org.acme.travels.service.HotelBookingService
org.acme.travels.service.FlightBookingService

Obviously this has been done for simplicity reasons. In a real application these functionalities would be implemented as microservices. However, the current implementation does show the power of Kogito processes definition integration with CDI.

== Cloning the repository
You are provided with a GitHub repository that contains 3 Kogito projects:

* 01-kogito-travel-agency: The base project which contains the _Booking System Service_. This project deploys as a single Quarkus application (JAR or Native Image) and does not support persistence.
* 02-kogito-travel-agency: The base project with persistence support. This project requires Infinispan / JBoss Data Grid.
* 03-kogito-travel-agency: Extension of project 3 with Kafka integration support to implement an Event Driven _Booking System Service_.

The GitHub repository can be found here: https://github.com/rhte2019-kogito/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial/


. Login to your workstation as explained in the previous paragraph.
. When logged in, clone the Kogito Lab repository:
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/rhte2019-kogito/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial.git
----
+
. Navigate tot the _Kogito Travel Agency Tutorial_ folder.
+
----
$ cd kogito-travel-agency-tutorial
----
+
. This folder contains the 3 projects that we will use during this lab.


== Lab 1: Kogito Development

https://kogito.kie.org/[_Kogito_] is the _Cloud-Native Business Automation platform for building Intelligent Applications_.
It's build on top of https://www.quarkus.io[Quarkus], a _Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards_.

One of the focusses of Quarkus, and thus of Kogito, is _Developer Experience_. Functionalities like _dev mode_ and _hot reload_ allows developers to make changes in their source code and configuration files, and immediately have these changes available in their test environment, without the need to explicitly compile and redeploy the application. This _hot reload_ functionality is only activated when the application is refreshed (for example when hitting the application with a RESTful request).

When you run `mvn compile quarkus:dev` {project-name}, the Kogito/Quarkus application will launch in development mode. When
it receives a HTTP request it will hold the request, and check to see if any application source
files (Java code, process definitions, rule definitions, etc.) have been changed. If they have it will transparently compile the changed files, redeploy
the application with the changed files, and then the HTTP request will continue to the redeployed
application. {project-name} redeploys are much faster than a traditional app server, so for all but the largest
applications this should take well under a second.
